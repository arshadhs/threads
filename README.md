**Multithredaing in cplusplus**

Multithreading is a feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of the CPU. Threads are lightweight processes within a process. 
Multithreading support was introduced in C++11. The thread classes and related functions are defined in the <thread> header file.

Basic components of a Thread:
1. Stack Space
2. Register Set
3. Program Counter

1. User Level Thread 
2. Kernel Level Thread

Four different states of a thread:
1. new
2. runnable
